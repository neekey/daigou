Ostelin Osteoguard is fortified with Vitamin K and magnesium for the maintenance of strong healthy bones, boron to aid calcium metabolism, and manganese to help maintain healthy bones and joints. Why Osteoguard? As we get older strong healthy bones and muscles are vital in reducing the incidence of falls and fractures. In Australia, 1 in 2 women and 1 in 3 men over the age of 60 will have a fracture due to Osteoporosis1. What is Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile and brittle, and can fracture more easily than healthy bone. \nBenefits of Ostelin OsteoguardOstelin Osteoguard is a high potency complex, specially formulated with 6 levels of support for strong bones:Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and increases bone density and is essential throughout life to help maintain healthy bone structure. Vitamin D aids in reducing bone loss in older people as Vitamin D status is affected by the aging process.Calcium assists in maintaining peak bone mass and increasing bone mineral density. After menopause women's requirements for calcium increase.Vitamin K works synergistically with vitamin D for bone health and helps the body transport calcium. Vitamin K is a co-factor for osteocalcin, a protein which influences bone mineral density.2 Both post menopausal women and the elderly have an additional requirement for vitamin K, which assists in the maintenance of bone mineral density by helping the body transport calcium.Magnesium is required by the body for normal bone function and bone metabolism and mineral density. The elderly may require additional magnesium which is important for maintaining normal blood calcium levels. Magnesium is also particularly important during and after menopause.Boron plays a role in Vitamin D, magnesium , phosphorous and calcium metabolism , and therefore a role in the maintenance of normal bone.Manganese is necessary for the development and maintenance of healthy bones and joints.
