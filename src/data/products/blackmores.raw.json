Lyprinol has Halal Certification.\nFeatures and benefits\n\nSymptomatic relief of osteoarthritis.\nTemporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis.\nHas anti-inflammatory properties.\nAdditional information\nInflammation is the body’s reaction to physical, chemical or biological injury. Normally this process localises the problem and results in regeneration or repair of damaged tissue. Unfortunately this process is not always beneficial in some people, and in some circumstances can actually cause further damage and injury.\nThere are many mechanisms in the body involved in the inflammatory response. Lyprinol helps to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the action of enzymes involved in the inflammatory pathway called the LOX pathway. By inhibiting these enzymes Lyprinol® can reduce both inflammation and pain, and yet does not interfere with the more positive aspects of the normal inflammatory response.\nLyprinol has a more complex lipid structure compared to other marine oils. This includes the presence of a number of compounds known to be anti-inflammatory, such as omega-3 fatty acids. This complex mixture of lipids is regarded as being essential to explaining the potent action of Lyprinol.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \nThis product is derived from shellfish.

Selenium has also been added for its antioxidant role in maintaining eye health.suggest that supplements containing natural lutein and zeaxanthin esters may increase the density of the macular pigments . Higher macular pigment density is associated with healthier eyes and the retention of visual sensitivity. In addition to absorbing potentially harmful blue light, lutein and zeaxanthin also function as antioxidants and may help reduce the risk of age-related macular damage by decreasing the cumulative effects of oxidative damage to the retina and lens . Selenium Lutein-Vision Advanced™ contains selenium as selenomethionine, an easily absorbed form of selenium .

Omega-3 fatty acids />Several studies have found that higher intakes of omega-3 fatty acids and fish are associated with better macular health . Very high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), are present in the retina, specifically in photoreceptor cells and the vascular part of the retina.

What this means is that less cholesterol is absorbed and more cholesterol is excreted.\t\t\tA daily dose of 2-3 grams of plant sterols from plant sterol-enriched food is recommended by the National Heart Foundation of Australia to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels.

Fatty acids are incorporated into every cell membrane in the body, in the form of compounds called phospholipids. Cell membranes play the vital role of regulating what goes into, and what comes out of each cell. The integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane is determined by the type of phospholipid that is available for the body to use. Cell membranes made up mainly of phospholipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids are more fluid and function better than cell membranes made up of saturated fat or trans-fatty acids. A cell membrane working at optimal levels retains vital nutrients and electrolytes, has the ability to communicate with other cells and is responsive to hormones. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils are generally regarded as having an anti-inflammatory effect in the human body. They are important components of substances known as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important in immune function, smooth muscle function, platelet aggregation and inflammation. Fish oils have an anti-inflammatory action because prostaglandins and leukotrienes from omega-3 fatty acids have less inflammatory activity than prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from other types of fatty acids. Fish oil inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver and so helps to lower fats (triglycerides) in blood, therefore supporting a healthy cardiovascular system. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      Contraindications and cautions If symptoms persist, see your healthcare professional. Always read the label.

CoQ10 has been extensively investigated for its benefits to the heart. It is a potent antioxidant and helps protect against free-radical damage therefore helping to maintain healthy arteries. CoQ10 is produced in the body with only a small amount found in the diet. However our ability to produce CoQ10 declines with age.\t\t\tA daily dose of 100mg of CoQ10 supports healthy heart function and helps to maintain the body’s levels of CoQ10.\t\t\tThis product is suitable for all adults concerned with general heart health and is a convenient way to increase levels of these two important nutrients.\t\t\t\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      \n    \n    \n      Directions\n      Active ingredients per capsule:\t\n\nAdults – Take 2 capsules a day with breakfast, or as professionally \nprescribed.\t\t\n\nChildren under 12 years – only as professionally prescribed.\t\t\n    \n    \n      Indications\n      \n      \n  "},{"id":"70119","link":"/buy/70119/Blackmores-Macu-Vision-Plus-60-Tablets","name":" Blackmores Macu-Vision Plus 60 Tablets","pic":"https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/productimages/70119/original.jpg","price":"19.99","description":"\n    \n      Information\n      \n    \n    \n      General Information\n      Features and benefits \n\nMay help to support healthy eye function and preserve overall eye health \nProvides antioxidant nutrients important to the macular region of the eye \nMay help maintain the density of the protective macular pigment of the retina\nA percentage of sales from Macu-Vision® Plus supports the MD Foundation \nAdditional information Macu-Vision® Plus is an antioxidant eyes formula containing nutrients that may help to protect against free radical damage in the macula. The macula is responsible for providing acute, central vision. Our ability to read, recognise faces, see fine detail and drive, all rely on the macula. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, lutein and zeaxanthin are found in high concentrations in the eye. The eye is susceptible to oxidative damage as it is constantly exposed to the effects of light and oxygen. Due to their chemical structure, lutein and zeaxanthin have the ability to scavenge free radicals and may help to protect the macula from oxidative damage. Supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin may increase macular pigment density. Higher macular pigment density may be associated with improved visual sensitivity at lower light levels.  Lutein and zeaxanthin may help to filter high-energy blue light, aiding eye function and may help to protect the cells from light induced damage. MacuVision® Plus is an eyes formula that provides nutrients important to the macular region of the eye and may also help maintain the density of the protective macular pigment of the eye. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      Contraindications and cautions WARNING – Contains zinc, which may be dangerous when used in large amounts or for a long period.  Not recommended for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Not recommended for children under 18 years. Always read the label.

It can also be added to fish oils to lesson 'fishy' reflux, and this certainly leaves a bad taste in our mouths. Because at Blackmores we prefer to use more natural ingredients, such as lemon and vanilla flavours, to keep our fish oils odourless. And it's our dedication to ensuring our products remain as naturally free from artifical chemicals as possible. Which means the only thing that's fishy about Blackmores Odourless Fish Oil is the goodness of the fish oil - without artificial flavours or chemicals such as polysorbate 80 - to help you be your best. Features and benefitsNo fishy aftertaste, developed without the use of artificial surfactants (polysorbates) Vanilla-lemon flavouring masks any fishy odours Natural source of omega-3s Helps to reduce inflammation and joint swelling associated with arthritis Helps to support heart and cardiovascular health Helps to assist in the maintenance of normal eye and brain function Helps to decrease triglycerides (fat) in the blood of healthy people Mercury tested How it worksFish oil is a source of the omega-3 essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are incorporated into every cell membrane in the body, in the form of compounds called phospholipids. Cell membranes play the vital role of regulating what goes into, and what comes out of, each cell. The integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane is determined by the type of phospholipid that is available for the body to use. Cell membranes made up mainly of phospholipids derived from the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids are more fluid and function better than cell membranes made up of saturated fat or trans-fatty acids. A cell membrane working at optimal levels retains vital nutrients and electrolytes, has the ability to communicate with other cells and is responsive to hormones. Omega-3 fatty acids are also important components of substances known as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important in immune function, smooth muscle function, platelet aggregation and inflammation. Fish oils have an anti-inflammatory action because prostaglandins and leukotrienes from omega-3 fatty acids have less inflammatory activity than prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from other types of fatty acids. Fish oils appear to alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis due to the role of omega-3 fatty acids in suppression of the production of inflammatory compounds. Fish oil inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver and so helps to lower fats (triglycerides) in the blood of healthy people, therefore supporting a healthy cardiovascular system. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      Contraindications and cautionsAlways read the label.

The skin and cells that line the airways and digestive tract provide the fi rst line of defence for the body. Vitamin A is needed for integrity of these cells which form an important barrier to infection. Vitamin A is also involved in 'regulating the proliferation of immune cells'.Vitamin CVitamin C is an antioxidant. It is a water soluble vitamin that is an essential nutrient and required in the diet on a regular basis. Vitamin C supports normal immune function.Vitamin DVitamin D receptors have been found in immune cells that are critical to the function and response of the immune system. The European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) has reviewed the evidence on vitamin D in relation to immune health. Based on the evidence presented they concluded that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin D and contribution to the normal function of the immune system.ZincLow levels of zinc (in the body) are associated with impaired immune responses and are associated with a reduction in function of most aspects of the immune system.

Echinacea has been extensively investigated and is known to have a variety of actions on the immune system, including elevation of serum white blood cell count (when numbers are low), promotion of non-specific T-cell activation (leading to a range of other activities including increased activity of natural killer cells and stimulating the release of interferon), enhancement of macrophage activity, as well as having antibacterial and antiviral properties.

Iodine deficiency in children and adolescents is associated with poorer school performance, reduced achievement and IQIodine: many teenagers have low levels of iodine, a nutrient that may support optimal intellectual development and function. Iodine deficiency in children and adolescents is associated with poorer school performance, reduced achievement and IQ.Omega-3 fatty acids: omega-3 fatty acids are essential for growth and development for all stages of life. The benefits of omega-3s are many including support of optimal brain development. Iron: many teenager girls do not consume an adequate amount of iron. Iron is an essential brain nutrient associated with normal memory, attention, learning, alertness, reasoning and cognition. An iron deficiency during adolescence may be associated with reduced work capacity and a less efficient response to exercise. Adolescent girls may be at risk of developing iron deficiency as a consequence of the combined effects of continued growth, menstrual iron losses and a low intake of iron. Zinc: many girls also consume less that the recommended daily intake of zinc. Zinc is an important nutrient needed for normal brain development. It is associated with normal cognitive functioning, attention and memory. Zinc is also important for immune function, cell growth and repair. Long term effects of mild zinc deficiency include delayed wound healing, and impaired immune function. Vitamin B12: another important brain development nutrient for optimal cognitive functioning and reasoning.

It is indicated for the treatment of anxiety, nervous tension and menopause-related anxiety.Investigation continues to determine how hypericum works physiologically, and several mechanisms of action have been proposed. Although, no single constituent of the plant can be considered to be responsible for the therapeutic action of the herb, hypericin (an oil-soluble anthraquinone glycoside) is considered to be an integral part of its action.

Deficiency is most prevalent in men and women aged 45 plus. Bio Magnesium is a supplement to aid in the prevention of magnesium deficiency states. If the body is low in magnesium it is forced to take it from muscles and without enough magnesium in muscles they stiffen up or contract at liberty. The result may be painful cramps, irritability, twitching or even tremors. Sufficient magnesium helps all muscles in the body to function optimally. Medical studies have shown calcium and magnesium to have a favourable impact on bone integrity and Bio Magnesium contains both calcium and magnesium for this purpose.Magnesium is essential for the electrical activity of nerves and muscle, and is indicated to relieve painful cramps (including menstrual cramps), twitching and tremors. Together with calcium, magnesium plays an integral role in tooth and bone hardness.Other nutrients present in Bio Magnesium also assist muscle function and include vitamins C and D (low intake has been associated with muscle fatigue), vitamin B6 and the mineral manganese which is involved in active phosphate transfer processes to provide muscle energy.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      This product contains pyridoxine hydrochloride which may be dangerous when used in large amounts or for a long time.\n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Active ingredients per tablet:\nMagnesium oxide - heavy 440mg,\nMagnesium phosphate 175mg,\n(equiv. to total magnesium 300mg);\nCalcium ascorbate 250mg;\nVitamin B6 (Pyridoxine hydrochloride) 50mg;\nVitamin D3 (Colecalciferol 2.5mcg) 100IU;\nManganese amino acid chelate 40mg,\n(equiv. to manganese 4mg)\n    \n    \n      Directions\n      Adults:\nTake one to two tablets daily with meals, or as professionally prescribed.\n\nChildren under 12 years:\nAs professionally prescribed.\n    \n    \n      Indications\n      \n      \n  "},{"id":"79158","link":"/buy/79158/Blackmores-B12-Rapi-Melt-1000mcg","name":" Blackmores B12 Rapi-Melt 1000mcg","pic":"https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/productimages/79158/original.jpg","price":"9.99","description":"\n    \n      Information\n      \n    \n    \n      General Information\n      Blackmores B12 Rapi-Melt 1000 mcg allows you to get your dose of 'body ready*' vitamin B12 on-the-go!\nThis great tasting melt provides a boost to your vitamin B12 intake in a convenient one-a-day dose and supports daily energy production. \n*A metabolically active form of vitamin B12 co-methylcobalamin. \n\nContributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue \nProvides a boost of vitamin b12 intake for vegans, vegetarians and those with limited meat and dairy intake\nHigh dose vitamin B12 \nHelps maintain healthy nerve and brain function\nVegetarian and vegan friendly\nNo added artificial colours, flavours or sweeteners. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Co-methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) 1000ug \n    \n    \n      Directions\n      Adult- Place 1 melt (orally disintegrating tablet) in your month until dissolved, once daily.

Lysine has been found to be active against the herpes virus in vitro, as it is able inhibit the metabolism of arginine - an amino acid required by the virus for replication. Supplementation with lysine should be accompanied by a diet high in foods rich in lysine (such as vegetables, legumes, fish, sprouts and dairy products), and avoiding foods rich in arginine (such as chocolate, nuts, oats, carob, coconut and soya beans). Clinical studies have shown that zinc supplementation leads to a reduction in the frequency, severity and duration of herpes outbreaks, and it is believed that this is due to the role that zinc plays in enhancing cell mediated immunity.

DHA is also a major structural component of the brain and retina. Omega-3s have an anti-inflammatory action in the body, may help maintain healthy bones and help maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. While science is still discovering all the ways in which EPA & DHA may help maintain heart health, we do know that they help promote a healthy cardiovascular system and reducing the body's production of inflammatory compounds. Vitamin D Vitamin D is required by the body for overall health and wellbeing. It plays a vital role in regulating calcium levels within the body, and therefore is important for healthy bones and bone density. It is also important for the health and strength of muscles, and may help reduce the risk of falls in the elderly through helping to maintain muscle function.

Research shows that taking valerian orally reduces the time taken to fall asleep and improves sleep quality. It also promotes healthy sleep patterns.Lemon Balm - has traditionally been used for its sedative and carminative actions. It was also used traditionally for the relief of tenseness, restlessness, irritability and for the relief of nervous sleep disorders. The medicinal use of lemon balm has been documented since Ancient Greek and Roman times. Since the Middle Ages it has been used internally as a sedative and carminative agent.Magnesium is important for the healthy function of the nervous system and muscle function. Research suggesets that individuals suffering with magnesium deficiency tend to have less time in deep sleep phases. Magnesium defi ciency has also been associated with increased night time wakefulness.\nSleepThe restorative value of sleep is well-established. The period of sleep called slow wave sleep or \"deep sleep\" is of particular importance. In a normal young adult slow wave sleep occupies some 20% of total sleep time. Between age 20 and age 30, theamount of slow-wave sleep drops by about half, and night time awakenings double. By age 40, slow-wave sleep is markedly reduced. When men and women enter middle age, slow-wave sleep continues to diminish, and night-time awakenings become more frequent and last longer. Prolonged reduction in slow wave sleep can lead to impaired mental and physical performance.\nSleep disorders may be due to factors such as sleep deprivation (from shift work, longer work hours and modern lifestyle), stress, illness, personal conflict, sudden schedule changes, and having young children.\nInsomnia is characterised by one or more of the following - difficulty initiating sleep, difficultly staying asleep and/or waking too early in the morning.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \nIf symptoms persist see your healthcare professional\nNot recommended for use during pregnancy and breast-feeding\n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Active ingredients per tablet:Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) extract equiv. to dry root (standardised to contain valerenic acid 900 µg) - 1.2g (1200 mg)\nMelissa officinalis (Lemon balm) extract equiv. to dry leaf - 825mg\nMagnesium phosphate(Magnesium 55 mg) - 266.2 mg\nNo added salt, yeast, gluten, wheat, milk derivatives, preservatives, artificial colours, flavours or sweeteners.

Omega-3 fatty acids are important building blocks of every cell in the human body and are essential for normal health and development.  Omega Daily is formulated with highly concentrated omega-3 fatty acids for people who don't eat enough fish.Features and benefitsDouble the omega-3s of standard fish oil. Omega-3s for those who don't eat enough fish. Helps to promote optimal health and wellbeing. Mercury, dioxin and PCB tested. Low odour without the use of artificial surfactants. How it works Fish oil is a source of the omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty acids are incorporated into every cell membrane in the body, in the form of compounds called phospholipids. Cell membranes play the vital role of regulating what goes into, and what comes out of each cell. The integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane is determined by the type of phospholipid that is available for the body to use. Cell membranes made up mainly of phospholipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids are more fluid and function better than cell membranes made up of saturated fat or trans-fatty acids. A cell membrane working at optimal levels retains vital nutrients and electrolytes, has the ability to communicate with other cells and is responsive to hormones. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils are generally regarded as having an anti-inflammatory effect in the human body. They are important components of substances known as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are important in immune function, smooth muscle function, platelet aggregation and inflammation. Fish oils have an anti-inflammatory action because prostaglandins and leukotrienes from omega-3 fatty acids have less inflammatory activity than prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from other types of fatty acids. Fish oil inhibits triglyceride synthesis in the liver and so helps to lower fats (triglycerides) in blood, therefore supporting a healthy cardiovascular system. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      Contraindications and cautionsIf symptoms persist, see your healthcare professional.

Deficiency is most prevalent in men and women aged 45 plus. Bio Magnesium is a supplement to aid in the prevention of magnesium deficiency states. If the body is low in magnesium it is forced to take it from muscles and without enough magnesium in muscles they stiffen up or contract at liberty. The result may be painful cramps, irritability, twitching or even tremors. Sufficient magnesium helps all muscles in the body to function optimally. Medical studies have shown calcium and magnesium to have a favourable impact on bone integrity and Bio Magnesium contains both calcium and magnesium for this purpose.Magnesium is essential for the electrical activity of nerves and muscle, and is indicated to relieve painful cramps (including menstrual cramps), twitching and tremors.

The body processes toxins in two main ways. Firstly they are converted into substances that are either inert or more readily excreted. This process is called neutralisation and occurs via complex enzymatic processes in the liver called phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification.\nAfter neutralisation, a substance can be eliminated from the body. This occurs primarily in the faeces via the liver and intestines and urine via the kidneys. The liver is by far the most important organ of detoxification. Every day, the liver produces and secretes nearly 1 litre of bile that helps to bind fat-soluble toxins for removal from the body.\nIf these detoxification pathways are overwhelmed, inhibited or fail, toxins may accumulate in body tissues, most frequently in fat tissue.\nAbout the ingredients:\nMilk thistle may help support liver health and helps support phase 1 and 2 detoxification. It may provide antioxidant support for the liver cells and protects the liver cells from free radical damage. It may also help support digestion.\nGlobe artichoke is used in traditional Western herbal medicine to support detoxification. It may help stimulate secretion of bile from the liver and gallbladder and aid elimination of waste from the liver and digestive tract.\nGreen tea, taurine and broccoli sprouts have antioxidant activity.\nSelenium may help support phase 1 and 2 detoxification and have antioxidant activity.\nCholine may help support liver function.\nWith B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5) which may help play a role in cellular energy production or with B vitamins.\nIn a blend of: inulin, lecithin, beetroot, carrot, lemon juice, plant-derived sweeteners (stevia, thaumatin, and xylitol), lemon/lime and orange flavour, citric acid, maltodextrin, calcium hydrogen phosphate and silicon dioxide.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \nGlobe artichoke may increase bile secretion.

Its potent anti-inflammatory action assists in the maintenance of healthy airways and breathing passages, and provides relief from joint swelling and arthritis.The two most common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Inflammation is involved in both conditions. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis. It commonly affects larger weight-bearing joints such as hips and knees, although the end joint of the fingers can also be involved. It is largely a disease of ageing, but can also result from sports-related injuries. Rheumatoid arthritis affects mainly smaller joints such as fingers, wrists and toes. It is an inflammatory condition that seems to come about when the immune system mistakenly attacks the joints. Arachidonic acid is the starting material from which potent inflammatory compounds such as leukotrienes are made. Lyprinol® appears to directly inhibit the enzymes known as 5 – lipoxygenase (5 – LOX), which are needed to convert arachidonic acid into these inflammatory compounds. In this way, Lyprinol® blocks the major pathways in the body which produce inflammatory compounds in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Lyprinol® has a more complex lipid structure compared to other marine oils. This includes the presence of a number of compounds known to be anti-inflammatory, such as omega 3 fatty acids and marine sterols. This complex mixture of lipids is regarded as being essential to explaining the potent action of Lyprinol®.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      This product is derived from shellfish, any allergies to shellfish products may be induced by this product.\n\nNot recommended for children under 2 years of age or pregnant and breast-feeding women.\n\nIf symptoms persist see your health care professional.\n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Active ingredient per capsule:\nMarine lipid extract (perna canaliculus oil) 50 mg\n\nNo added yeast, gluten, wheat, milk derivatives, preservatives, artificial flavours and sweeteners.\n    \n    \n      Directions\n      Adults: The recommended starting dose is two capsules in the morning and evening with meals for approximately 8 weeks.

Features and benefitsCombined arthritis pain relief Natural source of omega-3 fatty acids Results expected after 2-4 weeks Slows the progression of osteoarthritis Helps to increase joint mobility and reduce joint stiffness Helps to reduce joint inflammation and swelling Helps to reduce cartilage wearHow it worksGlucosamine is formed in the body from glucose and the amino acid glutamine, and is a key part of the structure of cartilage, which is essential for proper joint function. As we get older, cartilage becomes more susceptible to breakdown and damage, which may result in the typical symptoms of osteoarthritis. Supplementary glucosamine can be an important source of this vital amino sugar. Researchers found that 55% of patients with osteoarthritis of the knees had a clinically significant improvement in pain and mobility after a period of four weeks using glucosamine sulfate 1500mg (500mg three times daily)Fish Oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, and can be taken as a dietary supplement. \n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      \n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Glucosamine sulfate sodium chloride complex 650mg\nEquivalent to glucosamine sulfate 500mg\n\nFish Oil (natural) 500mg\nContaining omega-3 marine triglycerides 150mg as:\nEicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) 90mg\nDocosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) 60mg\n    \n    \n      Directions\n      Adults - Take 3 capsules a day with food, or as professionally prescribed.\n\nChildren (under 12 years) - Consult with a healthcare professional before use.\n\n    \n    \n      Indications\n      \n      \n  "},{"id":"42978","link":"/buy/42978/Blackmores-Bio-Ace-Excell-150-Capsules","name":" Blackmores Bio Ace Excell 150 Capsules","pic":"https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/productimages/42978/original.jpg","price":"42.24","description":"\n    \n      Information\n      \n    \n    \n      General Information\n      Blackmores Bio Ace Excell Pollutants, sun, stress, poor diet, alcohol and some medications can cause our bodies to produce free radicals which can lead to cell damage. Antioxidants are nutrients that reduce the risk of cell damage attributed to free radicals.Bio ACE Excell with grape seed + Selenium is a potent antioxidant providing nutrients that reduce the susceptibility of body tissues to free radical-mediated processes in cell membranes. Vitamins C and E are well documented for their powerful antioxidant activity and are the subject of clinical trials worldwide. They are combined here with betacarotene (another powerful antioxidant which may be indicated where there is a dietary deficiency of vitamin A), and zinc (which has an antioxidant role in the skin where it is involved in the functions of wound healing and normal oil gland function). The vitamins B1, B12 and folic acid are included due to their essential role in the metabolism of the amino acid homocysteine. Selenium is an essential antioxidant mineral that performs many functions in the body including preservation of normal liver function and maintaining resistance to disease.Grape seeds contain catechin polymers called oligomeric procyanidins (commonly known as OPCs), which are highly bioavailable and powerful antioxidants, appearing to be both complementary to and synergistic with vitamins (in particular they protect and complement the free radical scavenging effect of vitamin C). Grape seed extract assists in the maintenance of peripheral circulation and capillary fragility. Milk Thistle has a protective effect on the cell membrane which is mediated by a strong free radical scavenging and antioxidant action. It assists in detoxification processes in the liver by increasing the activity of super oxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      This product contains selenium which is toxic in high doses.

Longvida[R] is based on over 10 years research by neuroscientists at University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). It may support alertness and working memory (part of short-term memory) and may help reduce mental fatigue.\nBackground informationBack in the late 1990s, neuroscientists at UCLA embarked on a mission to fi nd natural compounds that had potential to support brain health. One of the ingredients they came across was turmeric and more importantly, its active constituent, curcumin. They saw that turmeric had an extensive history of use in humans, a low toxicity profile and possessed a diverse range of properties that were associated with general health and the brain, including anti-infl ammatory and antioxidant activity.\nBioavailability of curcuminUnformulated (regular) curcumin has poor oral bioavailability in humans. Using advanced SLCP technology, Longvida[R] encases the curcumin particle inside an optimised matrix layer. This helps to \"protect the curcumin from the harsh environment in the stomach and allows it to dissolve at the optimal point of absorption in the gastrointestinal tract\", for superior bioavailability.\nCurcumin in the brainCurcumin possesses antioxidant activity and turmeric extracts/ powders are well known for their anti-infl ammatory activity. The brain contains a high percentage of neurons and fatty acids, including the omega-3 fatty acid DHA. DHA is susceptible to free radical damage. Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, excessive inflammation and oxidative stress both appear to impact the brain.A 4-week trial in healthy older adults taking one capsule containing 400 mg Longvida[R] daily for 30 days helped to modify markers in the body associated with stress, antioxidant activity and brain health/ageing.\n    \n    \n      Miscellaneous\n      \n    \n    \n      Drug Interactions\n      \n    \n    \n      Warnings\n      Not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding\n    \n    \n      Common Uses\n      \n    \n    \n      Ingredients\n      Curcuma longa (turmeric) ext. dry conc.
